<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">As one of their software products IPG offers a library for customers to program and automate their own processes with their lasers. The library includes helpful functions and tools for connecting and outputting various graphics with the laser.</p>
<h2>My Part</h2>
<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">Upon starting my internship, I was tasked with configuring the library to generate automated documentation. Upon completion of this project, I became very familiar with the code, and was able to start fixing bugs and implementing new features. I wrote methods for transforming 3D objects, fixed issues with the generation of various graphics, implemented new features requested by customers, etc. Over the course of my work thus far, I have been responsible for updating and maintaining the library.</p>
