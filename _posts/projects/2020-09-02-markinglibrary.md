<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">As one of their software products, IPG offers a library for customers to program and automate their own processes with their lasers. The library includes helpful functions and tools for connecting to the laser and outputting various graphics and welds with it.</p>
<h2>My Part</h2>
<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">Upon starting my internship, I was tasked with configuring the library to generate automated documentation. While working on this project, I became very familiar with the code and was able to start fixing bugs and implementing new features. For example, I wrote an algorithm to project any 2D graphic onto a sphere using various mathematical methods in order to preserve some properties such as the area of objects, aspect ratio, angles, and vectors at the poles. I fixed various bugs with the rotation of shapes, shape fill, barcode generation, etc. Over the course of my work thus far, I have been responsible for updating, maintaining and releasing the library to customers.</p>
