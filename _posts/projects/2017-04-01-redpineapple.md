<p>"How can we stop people vaping?" was a hot topic in 2019, so we proposed a solution: a stationary device that detects when a person brings a juul close to their face and shoots the person with water, or any liquid of choice. For the hardware, I used an arduino connected to 2 servos to control the spray head. I used the C# .NET framework to set up a windows forms application for calibrating and controlling the system. I used OpenCV to train a CascadeClassifier to recognize a Juul, and detected when the Juul would intersected with the face detection CascadeClassifier. A webcam was connected to the computer running the C# code, and we converted the positional data of the </p>
