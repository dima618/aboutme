<p>This is a simple, open-ended project I did to learn Swift and get familiar with the IOS development environment. I used firebase as a backend for user authentication, user data storage, and location tracking. The idea was to create an app that finds nearby users within a certain radius and displays them to the current user. I used GeoFire to query locations in the Firebase real-time database. This project taught me a lot about Apple's framework for IOS development, and the structure of backend databases, and services. It also gave me something fun to do in my spare time.</p>
