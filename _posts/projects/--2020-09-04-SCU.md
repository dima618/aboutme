<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">IPG offers a utility for maintaining and managing the laser controllers. The utility offers a variety of useful features such as configuration file management, ability to upgrade controller firmware, virtual probe management, etc.</p>
<h2>My Part</h2>
<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">When I started my internship, the utility had a number of bugs and a UI that didn't scale well on smaller screens. I completed a total reskin of the software. I opted for using a customizable UI where each utility feature has its own snappable window. This styling allows the program to be operable on any screen size, and the user is able to decide which windows to have open. Apart from re-skinning, I fixed a multitude of bugs with laser discovery on the network, laser connection, and UI. I also implemented new features including adding the ability to check if a laser is using DHCP, merging a laser bit monitoring program into the utility, adding more ports to the monitoring feature, etc.</p>
