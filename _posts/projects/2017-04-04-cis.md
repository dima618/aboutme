<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">My supervisor at IPG has an ongoing project that I am lucky to be a part of. We are developing a proprietary continuous intergration system for the company SVN repository. Apart from building each solution, the system installs and runs each new commit of a software, then if necessary it tests the software using our laser controllers. The program acts as a safety net for all of the developers, and saves us tons of time on testing before a release.</p>
<h2>My Part</h2>
<p style="padding: 0 0 2rem;">I have been working on adding tests for the library I have been responsible for maintaining and updating over the course of my internship, and creating tests for the TCP command feature of our flagship software. Since testing each program requires a different approach, automated tests have to be coded independently for each software. The library tests execute every shape generation function and output each graphic with various properties using the laser to verify the communication between the laser and the library. The TCP tests send TCP commands to the software and verify that the return messages match the expected returns. It is important to make sure all of the return statements match perfectly, because our customers use the TCP feature to automate their own processes and we need to ensure that our TCP commands and their returns never change.</p>
